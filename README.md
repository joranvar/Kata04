Evaluation
----------

I tried a different answer type this time (because parsing a file without valid records could fail).

I also tried to re-design parse to use `words` only once.  Looks good, seems that the tests are quicker now.

I did not (yet) really refactor everything.  Maybe in my second pomodoro!

Cheers,
Bart
