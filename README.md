----------

This kata I spent waaaaaaay more time in researching how to implement `Read.readsPrec` than necessary.
Writing a parse function is the better way, anyway, because Read and Show should be complements, and I don't want to go there with this kata.

It's also kind of hard to write a good property test, here.
So I guess I'll stick with unit tests for the time being.
