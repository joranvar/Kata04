### Part One ###

This went quite fluently, now that I decided to implement `maybeParse` and `maybeWord`.
The domain logic is really simle (a type and two functions), but I managed to get the order of the fields wrong.
The fix was quite simle, because of the parser: really just switch the order in one place.

I really should have `maybeParse` and `maybeWord` in a tool belt somewhere.
Perhaps they already exist, but I will look into that later.

Time for part two!
