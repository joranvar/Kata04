So much time setting up the parsing...
I really should get the "maybe read" in my toolkit.

And it still feels strange to test "parse a line" and then "parse a file" in the unit tests,
especially since the code for testing "parse a line" is part of the code of "parse a file".

Oh well.

Tomorrow, tomorrow, there's always tomorrow.
